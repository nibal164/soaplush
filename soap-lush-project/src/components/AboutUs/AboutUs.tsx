        It all started when we created our own bars of soap. That unforgettable
        feeling when smelling all the aromas and found how skin caring would
        have such a blend of oil. It was a SoapLush that we’d like to share with
        you!! We started making soap for our family when our daughter developed
        a mild form of eczema that was made worse by commercially-produced soaps
        and washes. We spent months researching, and tried out loads of
        different recipes and combinations to find the ones that work for our
        daughter’s skin – and for us too. We settled on a combination of high
        quality ingredients, unfussy essential oil blends, and a slow
        soap-making process that is as close to the ancient traditional methods
        as possible. There’s nothing else added: no preservatives, no
        colourants, no fragrances and no additional heat to speed things up. The
        best things take time, and proper soap is worth waiting for. What
        started out as a necessity and family hobby quickly grew into a mini
        production line in our kitchen as friends and family started coming back
        for more. When they began “pre-ordering” before batches had cured, we
        knew we’d hit onto something special that we couldn’t keep to ourselves
        anymore. We’ve grown out of our kitchen and now make soap in our little
        workshop on a nearby farm, but we still ensure that each batch is
        carefully made by hand using the traditional cold process method and the
        finest natural ingredients. We don’t add anything to speed up the
        process, and we keep things as natural as possible. Each batch is given
        the full six weeks to cure before we share them with you. We are really
        proud of our soaps and we hope you love them as much as we do.
